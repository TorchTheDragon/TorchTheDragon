### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Torch, Torch the Dragon. If any of y'all want to DM me, I have a Twitter account (@TorchTheDwagon) and I also have a Discord, however, I won't accept random requests, so if you want my Discord, send me a message over Twitter first and I will respond when I can.

My pronouns are as follows: He, Him

How to reach me: Twitter and Discord

I am currently learning how to code basic stuff. I understand the overall concept of coding, I'm just learning how to do more. I strive to gain more knowledge in programming languages.

Fun Fact: I play CoD way too much. And FNF I suppose.
